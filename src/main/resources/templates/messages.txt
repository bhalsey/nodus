Text messaging 
or texting
is the act of composing and sending brief
electronic messages between two or more mobile phones
or fixed or portable devices over a phone network
The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS)
It has grown to include messages containing image
video
and sound content (known as MMS messages)
The sender of a text message is known as a texter
while the service itself has different colloquialisms depending on the region
It may simply be referred to as a text in North America
the United Kingdom
Australia
New Zealand and the Philippines
an SMS in most of mainland Europe
and a TMS or SMS in the Middle East
Africa and Asia
Text messages can be used to interact with automated systems to 
for example
order products or services
or participate in contests
Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to message mobile phone users about promotions
payment due dates
etcetera instead of using mail
e-mail or voicemail
In a straight and concise definition for the purposes of this English Language article 
text messaging by phones or mobile phones should include all 26 letters of the alphabet and 10 numerals
alpha-numeric messages
or text
to be sent by texter or received by the textee
1933 – RCA Communications 
New York introduced the first "telex" service 
[1] The first messages over RCA transatlantic circuits were sent between New York and London 
Seven million words or 300,000 radiograms transmitted the first year 
[citation needed] Alphanumeric messages have long been sent by radio using via Radiotelegraphy 
[2] Digital information began being sent using radio as early as 1971 by the University of Hawaii using ALOHAnet
The concept of the SMS (Short Messaging Service) was created by Friedhelm Hillebrand 
while he was working for Deutsche Telekom 
Sitting at a typewriter at home 
Hillebrand typed out random sentences and counted every letter 
number 
punctuation 
and space 
Almost every time 
the messages amounted to 160 characters 
thus being the basis for the limit one could type via text 
[3] With Bernard Ghillebaert of France Télécom 
he developed a proposal for the GSM group meeting in February 1985 in Oslo 
[4] The first technical solution was developed in a GSM subgroup under the leadership of Finn Trosby 
It was further developed under the leadership of Kevin Holley and Ian Harris (see Wikipedia: Short Message Service)
SMS messaging was used for the first time on 3 December 1992 
when Neil Papworth 
a 22-year-old test engineer for Sema Group in the UK[6] (now Airwide Solutions),[7] used a personal computer to send the text message "Merry Christmas" via the Vodafone network to the phone of Richard Jarvis[8][9] who was at a party in Newbury 
Berkshire which had been organised to celebrate the event
Modern SMS text messaging is understood to be messaging from one mobile phone to another mobile phone 
Radiolinja became the first network to offer commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994 
When Radiolinja's domestic competitor 
Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality 
Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered as a competitive as well as commercial basis
The first text messaging service in the United States was provided by American Personal Communications (APC) 
the first GSM carrier in America 
Sprint Telecommunications Venture 
a partnership of Sprint Corp 
and three large cable TV companies 
owned 49 percent of APC 
The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7 
7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses 
APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched service on November 15 
1995 in Washington D
and Baltimore Maryland 
The initial call to launch the network was made from Vice President Al Gore in Washington
to Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore 
[10] Soon to follow was Omnipoint Communications 
[11] Omnipoint's George Schmitt 
a former Airtouch executive[12] who launched commercial GSM in Germany 
recruited Roger Wood[13] from competitor iDEN / Nextel led a team that introduced texting as a commercial service in New York City in November 1996 
[9] In preparation for the company's launch party in New York's Central Park 
Wood and co-worker Mark Caron[14] sent the first SMS Text message of "George are you there?" to Schmitt during a Sunday morning RF drive test on October 20 
1996 
Omnipoint soon offered the first texting between the U
and the rest of the world 
[15] The tipping point for text messaging was the 1998 marketing plan conceived by Wood which encouraged consumers to use texting as the primary way to communicate with their home countries while traveling overseas instead of calling home 
[16] This positioning set the stage for text messaging as the primary means of contact between two or more people not in their home countries
Initial growth of text messaging was slow 
with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0 
4 message per GSM customer per month 
[18] One factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems 
especially for prepaid subscribers 
and eliminate billing fraud 
which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators 
Over time 
this issue was eliminated by switch-billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it
SMS is available on a wide range of networks 
including 3G networks 
However 
not all text messaging systems use SMS 
and some notable alternate implementations of the concept include J-Phone's SkyMail and NTT Docomo's Short Mail 
both in Japan 
E-mail messaging from phones 
as popularized by NTT Docomo's i-mode and the RIM BlackBerry 
also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP/IP
Today 
text messaging is the most widely used mobile data service 
with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide 
or 2 
4 billion out of 3 
3 billion phone subscribers 
at end of 2007 being active users of the Short Message Service 
In countries such as Finland 
Sweden and Norway 
over 85% of the population use SMS 
The European average is about 80% 
and North America is rapidly catching up with over 60% active users of SMS by end of 2008 
The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers is in the Philippines 
with an average of 27 texts sent per day by subscriber
SMS is widely used for delivering digital content 
such as news alerts 
financial information 
logos and ringtones 
Such messages are also known as premium-rated short messages (PSMS) 
[40] The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content 
and the amount is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the value added service provider (VASP) 
either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee 
Services like 82ASK and Any Question Answered have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers' questions 
using on-call teams of experts and researchers
Premium short messages are increasingly being used for "real-world" services 
For example 
some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium-rated short message 
so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user's phone bill or subtracted from the user's prepaid credits 
Recently 
premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills
A new type of free-premium or hybrid-premium content has emerged with the launch of text-service websites 
These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale 
or when new items are introduced
An alternative to inbound SMS is based on long numbers (international mobile number format
+44 7624 805000 
or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS 
01133203040[39])
which can be used in place of short codes or premium-rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications 
such as TV voting 
product promotions 
and campaigns 
Long numbers are internationally available 
as well as enabling businesses to have their own number 
rather than short codes 
which are usually shared across a lot of brands 
Additionally 
Long numbers are non-premium inbound numbers 
In business[edit]
The use of text messaging for business purposes has grown significantly during the mid-2000s 
As companies seek competitive advantages 
many employees turn to new technology 
collaborative applications 
and real-time messaging such as SMS 
instant messaging 
and mobile communications 
Some practical uses of text messaging include the fuse of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks 
for instant communication between a service provider and a client
stock broker and investor) 
and for sending alerts 
Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts 
One such example is Penn State
As text messaging has proliferated in business 
so too have regulations governing its use 
One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks 
equities 
and securities trading is Regulatory Notice 07-59 
Supervision of Electronic Communications 
December 2007 
issued to member firms by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
In 07-59 
FINRA noted that "electronic communications" 
"e-mail" 
and "electronic correspondence" may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging 
[42] Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees' text messages
Security 
confidentiality 
reliability and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services 
energy and commodities trading 
health care and enterprises demand in their mission-critical procedures 
One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs (Service Level Agreement) 
which are common in IT contracts 
By providing measurable SLAs 
corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services 
[43] Just one of many SMS applications that has proven highly popular and successful in the financial-services industry is mobile receipts 
In January 2009 
Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) published the Mobile Banking Overview for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services (SMS) 
Mobile Web 
Mobile Client Applications 
SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS
Mobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty
Typical business-to-business applications are telematics and Machine-to-Machine 
in which two applications automatically communicate with each other 
Incident alerts are also common 
and staff communications are also another use for B2B scenarios
Businesses can use SMS for time-critical alerts 
updates and reminders 
mobile campaigns 
content and entertainment applications
Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer-to-business interactions 
such as media voting and competitions 
and for consumer-to-consumer interaction 
for example 
with mobile social networking 
chatting and dating
Worldwide use[edit]
Europe[edit]
SMS is used to send "welcome" messages to mobile phones roaming between countries 
Here 
T-Mobile welcomes a Proximus subscriber to the UK 
and BASE welcomes an Orange UK customer to Belgium
Europe follows next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS 
In 2003 
an average of 16 billion messages were sent each month 
Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003 
In Italy 
Germany and the United Kingdom 
the figure was around 35–40 SMS messages per month 
In each of these countries 
the cost of sending an SMS message varies from €0 
04–0 
23 
depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or a number of texts for free) 
In the United Kingdom 
text messages are charged between £0 
05–0
Curiously
France has not taken to SMS in the same way 
sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month 
France has the same GSM technology as other European countries 
so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions 
In the Republic of Ireland
a total of 1 
5 billion messages are sent every quarter 
on average 114 messages per person per month 
In the United Kingdom over 1 billion text messages are sent every week
The Eurovision Song Contest organized the first pan-European SMS voting in 2002
as a part of the voting system (there was also a voting over traditional phone lines) 
In 2005 
the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever (with SMS and phone voting) 
During roaming
that is 
when a user connects to another network in different country from his own 
the prices may be higher 
but in July 2009 
EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to €0
